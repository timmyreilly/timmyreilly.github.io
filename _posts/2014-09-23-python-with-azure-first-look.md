I have a portion of a talk at Silicon Valley Code Camp! I'll be discussing Python w/ Azure. So far, I've been ramping up on [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ "Python Tutorial") so I can keep the talk relevant. In my learning I've come across some really awesome cultural tidbits that contribute to the awesomeness of Python Development.

1. First [Guido van Rossum](https://www.python.org/~guido/ "His Site"), he is the Author of python. He is "[Gawky and proud of it.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1998/raymond120398.htm "Article About Open Source Movement")"
2. Python is written as Guido intended er... _indented_ it.
3. PEPs or Python Enhancement Proposals are the way the Python community provides design documentation. Some contain Easter eggs and/or philosophical life lessons. They drive the progress of Python.
4. The Zen of Python. This is what really blew me away about Python's culture. [PEP 20](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ "PEP 20 ") is the Zen of Python. A philosophical view of how Python is written and helps developers maintain readable, beautiful code. Its absolutely wonderful maybe worth memorizing, and totally worth reading. You can access the Zen of Python simply by entering "import this" in the REPL. Ahhh so relaxing.

There are many great resources to get started with Python if this seems to align your [Chakra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra "CHAKRA"). (Tobiah said this earlier today and it made me laugh)

[The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ "Great place to start") [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/) [The Codeacademy Way](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python "CodeAcademy ")

If you're a student or teacher check to see if you have access to Lynda.com or Pluralsight as they both have great tutorial videos.

[Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "sublime's site") is a great editor for getting started. And [Visual Studio](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9ea113de-a009-46cd-99f5-65ef0595f937 "Python Tools for Visual Studio!") has some great tools for python development. [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx "Scott's Block ") has a great blog for getting started with VS.
