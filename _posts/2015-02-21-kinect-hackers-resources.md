I've found a couple helpful links for folks looking to develop with Kinect.

**First Understanding what's happening with the sensors:** [This site does an excellent job explaining how the Kinect calculates depth](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielLau/20131127/205820/The_Science_Behind_Kinects_or_Kinect_10_versus_20.php "Gamasutra"). **Second the SDK:** [This is the home page for all things Kinect Dev.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/ "SDK Landing Page ") I would recommend scrolling down to the support page at the bottom of this site. The [FAQ](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/meetkinect/faq.aspx "FAQ Page") is a great start.

**Third:Developer Groups** [The Kinect Community Forums are great](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=kinectsdks "Forum Site!") & [OpenKinect is another active and resource rich community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openkinect "Lots of good stuff in here")

Please let me know if you have any other resources to share! I'd love to see your hack as well!
