**Here's more info if you're curious!**

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a cross platform text editor. Think Sublime, Atom, Notepad++, but with intellisense, git integration, and debugging!

A fellow TE, Tobiah Zarlez, has broken down some key features that I found super helpful: [Tobiah's Post](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/2015/05/visual-studio-code/)

There is also great documentation on the code website about…

[Supported Languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages)

[Editing](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editingevolved)

[Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/debugging)

[Customization](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/customization)

[Feedback](http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/293070-visual-studio-code)

The VS Code documentation is loaded with images and is an efficient way to become productive quickly.

**Visual Studio Community Edition**

If you're looking for a more robust toolkit, I would also recommend Visual Studio Community Edition. This new edition is a free version of the previously priced $1000 pro version. It still supports plugins, server integration, and advanced debugging, but is free for teams smaller than 10 people. For students this could be an invaluable tool for projects.

**Windows 10**

Is the latest and greatest Windows operating system. Its right around the corner with some pretty awesome features.

It will be officially available July 29th, but is currently in free insider preview for people willing to get their hands on the latest bits.

Here's a quick breakdown:

**Edge Browser**

Alongside the new OS is a brand new browser. This browser is fast, modern, and built for the next generation of the internet. It was previously codenmaed Spartan.

Here's a quick breakdown:

[Developer Feedback](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer)

[User Feedback](https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/285214-microsoft-edge)

Both the Browser and Windows 10 are in ([free](https://insider.windows.com/)) preview until July 29th when Windows 10 is released as a free upgrade for licensed PCs running Windows 7, 8, or 8.1.

Speaking of development pipelines… Open Sourced .NET!

**Open Sourced .NET Core and ASP.NET:** 

Open sourced .NET means .NET on different operating systems. Giving developers with all background the opportunity to build extremely powerful and extensible applications. Check out the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework).

Here's a quick breakdown:

[The ASP.NET open source page for Javascript fans](http://www.asp.net/open-source)

[The Feedback Page for ASP.NET](http://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41199-general-asp-net)

The best part of these new products and innovations is the way they are being built. The consumers, myself included, are the product owners and our voice and suggestions are taken into account at each build cycle. So as you use the product you can post suggestions and upvote ideas to see them get sent down the development pipeline!

We want your opinion! You can shape the future of these projects!

Wooot!
