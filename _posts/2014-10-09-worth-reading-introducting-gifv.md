Imgur.com has released a new file format for sharing .GIFs! It's called .GIFV. It uses MP4 for the magic and loads much quicker and smoother than old school (1987) gifs! Hooray!

[Here's the original article](http://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/ "imgur.com")

_Why should I read this?_ Its going to change mobile and web experiences. _So?_ People will have access to richer content without the memory costs and bandwidth usage. _So?_ More interactive sites means you could be left behind if you don't adopt the newest format. _Oh?_ Well kinda, stuff will still work, but look at how shiny and smooth the two gifs in the article are. Or [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifv "r/gifv") on Reddit.

_Dang._
