# Hardware feedback

## New macbooks

The hardware that the M1 MacBook uses is not good. I prefer the lenovo and surface builds more. MacOS is swell, but coupled to the fact that you can't sideload other operating systems makes me whince. All this potential shoehorned. 

## Surface book 2

the big screen and nice keyboard make for a complete computer experience. 

## Surface Laptop Studio

The medium screen and clumsy interface trackpad + touchpad experience is so confusing it just leaves you disappointed. 

## Kindle - paperwhite v2

I don't actually know what generation, but the battery is weak and the screen still seems pretty good. That's an amazing little piece of kit reading wize. Very excited for the next boox palma. Probably what I'll replace the kindle with.
