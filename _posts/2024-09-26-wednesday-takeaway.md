# Some misc. notes

The two foot long feathers of the bird disjoint from the evolution and survivability of the bird. 

The x-y axis of "pushing the artistic envelop" and "common appeal"
The z axis is time, the n-th axis can be money/prestige/curb appeal. 

The backup roll for a friend going on a trip and leaving their toddler with the grandma. 

## Another day - 2 October 2024

The shamrock plays good music. We discovered we're not so sure about 'food games', drinking games we're pretty sure about but 'food games' we're not really sure what that means. Either really spicy, or really dense, or real volume. The great american challenge is the most distinct 'food game' I've experienced on in the west. 

Speaking of the west, the glut's provide culture. The act of generating culture, means accepting that there's a glut of access. A good way to generate culture is provide a big pot of beans for everyone to eat. 

With loaves of bread, cheese, and something shared by others. Maybe a big salad. That's culture, that's space for people to roll up their sleeves and participate in something beyond their day to day. 

Describing the merit of the socratic method, or the reverse socratic method, describing to the children the gravy, the force that binds all of us together 'gravy-ty'. How gravy is the force that binds all of us, but then watching the kids explain it to each other correcting the teacher every step of the way, but also subtle in it's effectiveness. We can see the imagination fluttering as they approach their own comprehension of what's being described and then again when their peer describes it, sounds like 'Diffusion of Innovation'. 

The scary thing for a teacher in a room of 30 students is someone silently spilling paint. 
If that number is 10, is the teacher less scared? 

Describing the balance of following your passion and following the money. But you're forgetting about the third axis... Time. Daniel was making a pretty compelling argument for the role of changing roles has in those decisions as we target school and higher ed, we're really dialing into a specific premise. But time and change break that up in ways that's hard for humans to discern and separate. The last 20 years have been pretty linear/flat in ways that it's hard to keep in perspective when you're 16 and picking your major. A nice perspective to discuss with a parent. 

## 3 October 2024

The man had three screenplays in his head. 80% of the old poem and the complete dutch gambit. Well, maybe it's noa gambit, but it sure seems like the right type of word as we enter into chess land. Being good at chess is cool, but I don't know if I found getting my ass handed to me very fun. Developing plays in unique ways, bringing things off the back, some of the language around what's being used. It was interesting, but the permutations don't seem distinct enough to be relevant for enough games/fun unless you had played a ton. And people just are able to play a ton and then you'll always lose to them?? Skill being separate from experience? Taking your licks, that's another part of learning that's hard to replicate without projects.

Takeaways, backgammon is the ideal bar game, so simple pretty fun, almost team oriented. Just the right amount of risk. Never really know what's going to happen. Playing chess is like the pressure of the world. 

## 18 October 2024

We're looking at Mayoral races. A friend is going to a brunch with London Breed, the reality being you'll probably just bungle the discussion anyways. 
What are you supposed to say to a mayor. 

Also, the aesthetics of the valencia bike lane. 

Type 1 fun: Eating a cookie and enjoying it
Type 2 fun: Going to the gym and having fun feeling strong after
Type 3 fun: Fun that can I have good story like slipping on a banana peel and it not being fun in the moment. 

Lol. 

I've also enjoyed the 3rd being a little more dire... but I guess slipping on a banana peel could be pretty dire. 

And I've also heard to more like... the second one's been tough for me to pin down. I want to say something like getting in mild trouble but getting away with it? 

Or like going to the DMV? Like it's just not fun and then it's sort of funny when you're all done. But actually the DMV might be the fourth, not fun and not fun after. 

2 is still illusive. 

## 21 October 2024

Looking forward to a plane ride tomorrow. Make sure to charge the fancy headphones and sit back for 6 hours of uninterrupted chilling. 

I also look forward to writing, taking 10 minutes to talk about stuff. 

Book review of the bible... Freaking nuts and amazing to read stories about a world that old. Reminds me of the Tain, in terms of livestock management. All the stories give glimpses into the world of food and gifts of the time. Someone wrote down something that represents some bit of truth. That's kind of the point of all writing. Even writing blatant lies gives us some insight. 

Writing lies is hard?? Is that a lie?? 

The truth is pretty wispy anyways. We're always locked to so much context when we try to assert anything. 

Error corrected Quantum systems... listening to the TED talk by the Quantum guy at Google. His outfit was freaking awesome for a talk about Quantum. All discussions of Quantum should be done with such glasses.

Some thoughts about sprinting and working with Software Engineering Groups

the variable of participation can be really disorienting. I think I get confused when we kick off a sprint but people are split among different requirements I think for us to work most effectively with a customer regularly pairing with ProductOwners and Developers for engineering sessions can provide maximum value. I think the representation of a sprint could extend to a more deliberate timeframe for co-working. 

There's an efficiency curve that I'm always trying to hit when writing code and sometimes I get discouraged from finding that curve as I don't know if others are alongside me? It's a weird feeling but when you are on the edge of understanding alongside someone it can be really rewarding when together you accomplish insight.
