# Some misc. notes

The two foot long feathers of the bird disjoint from the evolution and survivability of the bird. 

The x-y axis of "pushing the artistic envelop" and "common appeal"
The z axis is time, the n-th axis can be money/prestige/curb appeal. 

The backup roll for a friend going on a trip and leaving their toddler with the grandma. 

## Another day 

The shamrock plays good music. We discovered we're not so sure about 'food games', drinking games we're pretty sure about but 'food games' we're not really sure what that means. Either really spicy, or really dense, or real volume. The great american challenge is the most distinct 'food game' I've experienced on in the west. 

Speaking of the west, the glut's provide culture. The act of generating culture, means accepting that there's a glut of access. A good way to generate culture is provide a big pot of beans for everyone to eat. 

With loaves of bread, cheese, and something shared by others. Maybe a big salad. That's culture, that's space for people to roll up their sleeves and participate in something beyond their day to day. 

Describing the merit of the socratic method, or the reverse socratic method, describing to the children the gravy, the force that binds all of us together 'gravy-ty'. How gravy is the force that binds all of us, but then watching the kids explain it to each other correcting the teacher every step of the way, but also subtle in it's effectiveness. We can see the imagination fluttering as they approach their own comprehension of what's being described and then again when their peer describes it, sounds like 'Diffusion of Innovation'. 

The scary thing for a teacher in a room of 30 students is someone silently spilling paint. 
If that number is 10, is the teacher less scared? 

Describing the balance of following your passion and following the money. But you're forgetting about the third axis... Time. Daniel was making a pretty compelling argument for the role of changing roles has in those decisions as we target school and higher ed, we're really dialing into a specific premise. But time and change break that up in ways that's hard for humans to discern and separate. The last 20 years have been pretty linear/flat in ways that it's hard to keep in perspective when you're 16 and picking your major. A nice perspective to discuss with a parent.
