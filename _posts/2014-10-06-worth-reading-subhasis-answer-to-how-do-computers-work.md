This is a great question! And Subhasis has a great [answer](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Science/How-does-a-computer-chip-work/answer/Subhasis-Das?share=1 "Quora Link for Answer "). The challenge of this question is met, and follow up continues with other great responses. Subhasis also provides this [link](http://cpuarch.quora.com/ "CPU Architecture") for further reading as a continuing series. The former is worth reading for anyone living with a computer.

[This article](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Science/How-does-a-computer-chip-work/answer/Subhasis-Das?share=1 "Link to Answer Again") is worth reading because...

Subhasis answer is great a explaining the fundamental attributes of computers. _Why?_ Provides an easy to read introduction to many complicated components. _Why is that important?_ Understanding the components is essential for understanding the system. _Why do I care about this system?_ Understanding [systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking "Systems thinking link ") is valuable for understanding why things are the way they are. _Why does that matter?_ If we understand why things are the way they are, we can get at the root of how to improve them. _Alright, fine I'll read it._
