title: "Minimal Django Site on Azure"

I've found myself confused in the mire of code deployed when a Django site is pulled down from Azure, so Ryan Joy and myself have stripped it to the bare essentials for a code challenge during DjangoCon.

I found this project to be a great way to learn how Django works and how to get into web development while making your changes actually exist on the internet.

We've made a number of repos, but the best one to get started with is [MinimalStaticDjango](https://github.com/timmyreilly/MinimalStaticDjango)

The main parts of the app can be found in app and djangocon and these are standard django.

The deployment specific code includes: • .deployment • deploy.cmd • ptvs\_virtualenv\_proxy.py • web.2.7.config • web.3.4.config • web.debug.config

With this site (and quite a bit of bootstrap), you can create and deploy beautiful static sites.

And with a great idea and a database you can extend this basic structure to any kind of Django website.

Look for another example in the coming months after a hackathon or two!

Happy to answer any questions, Tim
