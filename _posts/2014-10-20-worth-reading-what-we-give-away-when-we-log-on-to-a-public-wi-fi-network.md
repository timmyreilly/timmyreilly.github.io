From the Correspondent and Maurits Martijn is [THIS](https://decorrespondent.nl/1101/What-we-give-away-when-we-log-on-to-a-public-Wi-Fi-network/31040493-53737dba "the Correspondent") great article highlighting vulnerabilities we subject ourselves to when we join a open Wi-Fi network.

_Why should I read this?_ Have you ever joined an open Wi-Fi network? _Yes._ This article will open your eyes the dangerous world you're entering. _How so?_ Well personal/private information can be gleaned from your network traffic. And financial info can be stolen or skimmed. _So what am I gonna do? I love free internet!_ [Here's a link about how to protect yourself.](https://decorrespondent.nl/1103/How-to-safely-use-a-public-Wi-Fi-network/31096879-74f654ff "Hold Fast")
