Microsoft is supporting a couple awesome events in the next couple days that I'd love to share with you!

![civictechchallenge]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/civictechchallenge.png)

First Local Students will be working alongside local techies to pitch solutions in three areas:

1: Data Visualizations to Influence Change 2: Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) for Mass Coordination and Civic Empowerment 3: Digital Storytelling to Raise Awareness

If by chance you are around and interested in participating, either as “hackers” or volunteers, please let me know. You are also welcome to come only for the reception (6-9pm), if you’d like.

[Jennifer Pahlka](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/author/jen/) of Code for America will be our keynote speaker!!

**Also, Microsoft's new Reactor Space is open!**

We'd love to see you there.

We have a pretty sweet one coming up for all the Node developers out there.

Node.js and npm for the Windows Developer: [Link to Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Microsoft-Events/events/226495311/)

We’re partnering with the folks over at Node Package Manager(npm) to put together an awesome event in our new Reactor community space on Nov 9th. Highlights include: • Getting started and setting up a rockin’ dev environment • Overcoming common gotchas without pulling your hair out • Managing packages for your Node.js apps like a champ • Bobbleheads (we’ll explain later…)
