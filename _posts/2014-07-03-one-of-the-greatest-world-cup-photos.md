[Here's the original post on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldcup/comments/29ncf3/usa_vs_belgium_2014_i_headed_downtown_orlando_and/). The comments are great too.

Soccer is big in America now.

Even though we loss, all these people together are rooting for one team. We win or loss together, because we're the United States of America. Hooray for Patriotism! Hooray for soccer! and have a great Fourth of July!
