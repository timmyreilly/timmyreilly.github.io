I started my role as a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft on July 7th, and will be contributing to this blog weekly; blurring the lines between professional evangelist and unprofessional man of many curiosities.

If you have any questions about Windows development or being a man, please don't hesitate to ask!

Today on the agenda, is practicing presentation skills. One of our many mentors, John Alioto, has given us a couple of topics to research and use as material for our 5 minute talk.

Ahhhh good question John. Taking us back to compilers... We'll get to the full rundown later this week.
