The last two days I've been learning about Visual Studio Code Extensions!

This for all the Node/JavaScript Developers out there.

In the end, writing an extension turned out to be a joy. You basically get to create a little program that changes a tool you use everyday and tweak it to exactly what you want then easily publish this to the world.

I made Typewriter Sounds. Here's the [Repo](https://github.com/timmyreilly/TypewriterNoises-VSCode) and the [marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/timreilly.typewriter-sounds)

If you install this plugin, you'll get typewriter sounds as you begin to edit your markdown file.

All the code is available on GitHub, and the instructions for creating your own extension are available on the well documented Visual Studio Code Extensions website!

I thought I'd share some links and resources to help you get started.
