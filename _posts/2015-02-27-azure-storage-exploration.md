Hey There, during my work studying for my Azure Exam/Working on my Hug the Cloud project. I've found accessing and understanding my stored data a bit confusing.

Luckily, someone shared [this link](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2014/03/11/windows-azure-storage-explorers-2014.aspx "Lots of option") with me. Here you can find a number of available azure file/table/queue explorers.

I chose the first explorer ['Azure Storage Explorer'](http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/ "Codeplex Download Page") It works well, is easy to use, and is totally free.

Once you have it downloaded you'll be met with this page: \[caption id="attachment\_3541" align="aligncenter" width="660"\]![Use add account to create a new storage view. ]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/azurestoragesimple-1024x580.png) Use add account to create a new storage view. \[/caption\]

Go to your azure portal and find the info about your storage account in the 'manage access keys' section. (You can see the manage access keys button at the bottom of this photo): \[caption id="attachment\_3551" align="aligncenter" width="577"\]![From Azure Portal select Storage -> 'Name of Storage Account']({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/managekeyspage.png) From Azure Portal select Storage -> 'Name of Storage Account'\[/caption\]

Use the name and the primary key and put that info in here: ![putinhere]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/putinhere.png)

This has made it much easier for me to organize my project data, and understand what's happening inside my storage accounts.

Notice the three different types of storage? [(Blob, Queue, and Table)](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DCIM-B384#fbid= "Greta Video About Azure Storage") \[caption id="attachment\_3571" align="aligncenter" width="634"\]![Looks pretty good]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/azurestorageaccount.png) Looks pretty good\[/caption\]

Let me know if you have any questions! Had a great time at TreeHacks last weekend. Check out [this link](http://treehackswinter2015.challengepost.com/submissions/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93 "Challenge Post Site") for some great Stanford hacks!
