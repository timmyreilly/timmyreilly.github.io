Today was my last day of class, and to reflect I've written down 10 things I'm glad I did. There are many more than 10 things, but these are the first that came to my mind as advice I could give to anyone going in college. Must-do's are in bold.

1. **Rock Climb**
2. Work on an assignment until 4am with someone (Bonus: Lost Lake Challenge)
3. **Volunteer**
4. Take a class you didn't know existed, especially if you have to take a field trip (eg. Sound as Art)
5. **Practice introducing yourself and asking for someone's name/contact info**
6. Go to a house party just to watch
7. Practice and begin toÂ accept peoples' differences
8. Live on campus and off campus if you can
9. Get a bike
10. **Go to office hours**

College is fun.
